calibration_widget_v03.py is the latest version of the calibration widget.

Currently not implemented/working:
> Open/Save buttons for Regions and Calibration (Calibrated spectra are automatically saved when
> Button "Remove Files" for file list is not working properly. It somehow messes up the internal list of file identifiers.
> Button "Open file(s)" for file list supports only hdf5 files at the moment
